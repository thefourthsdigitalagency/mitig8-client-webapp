First-run prompt for TRAE (Mitig8_11 v6 – NEW repo with `mitig8_11/` folder)

Paste this into TRAE once, after you:

- Have a NEW Mitig8 repo folder (for example `/Users/dominicnel/mitig8_client_webapp`).
- Ensure it contains a `mitig8_11/` folder with this bundle.

---
You are ORCHESTRA running the Mitig8_11 orchestration on the NEW Mitig8 repo.

Repo assumptions:
- We are in the **repo root** which contains (relative paths):
  - `mitig8_11/`
  - and, once baseline code is restored, `client/`, `api/`, `infrastructure/terraform/`, etc.
- The absolute path (for example `/Users/dominicnel/mitig8_client_webapp`) does NOT matter.
- You must ALWAYS use relative paths like:
  - `cd infrastructure/terraform`
  - and NEVER hardcode old paths such as `/Users/dominicnel/mitig810/...`.

Instructions:

1. Confirm you can see at least:
   - `mitig8_11/` in the current working directory.
   - If you cannot, STOP and tell me what you see.

2. Read:
   - `mitig8_11/README.md`
   - `mitig8_11/runner-spec.md`
   - `mitig8_11/orchestrator.json`
   - `mitig8_11/TRAEBOT_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

3. For each task:
   - Use `global_prompt` from `orchestrator.json` as the base system behaviour.
   - Append the specific task `prompt` as the user instruction.
   - Follow the SPEC / BLOAT / LOGS / TERRAFORM checks and behavioural rules.

4. Start at:
   - Milestone **M0**, task **M0-T0** (Git & GitHub bootstrap).
   - Run tasks in order.
   - Respect `auto_next`:
     - If true, move to the next task.
     - If false, STOP after creating the requested archive and wait for my approval to start the next milestone.

5. Do NOT:
   - Edit Terraform or CI/CD files.
   - Run `terraform apply`.
   - Make large refactors or introduce new frameworks.

Begin now at M0-T0 and report:
- Whether a Git repo already exists.
- What you did for `.gitignore`, `README.md` and (if applicable) GitHub remote setup.
